 **Weather App using geolocation**

----------------------------------

This is a simple weather app made with native JavaScript, HTML and CSS that uses the browser's geolocation module in order to retrieve the longitude and latitude, furtherly these 2 parameters are being fed to the OpenWeatherMap API (you can check it <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">here</a>) in order to display the data.

It automatically detects the settlement and the country it belongs to.
The app will refresh automatically every 10 minutes for accuracy 
You can switch between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin, it defaults to Celsius as I am from Europe.

I have made this app as an exercise, but also to learn more and practice on my front end and general programming skills and knowledge.

You can try out the app <a href="https://vladislav-ss.github.io/weather-app/">HERE (GitHub pages)</a>.
*Don't forget to allow the browser to retrieve the geolocation data.

Thank you for checking this out.
